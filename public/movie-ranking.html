<h1>The Best Movies According to Praveen</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. I love the story.</p>
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>t is one of those rare films that, when you finish it, you feel like you've actually gained something meaningful from it.</p>
<h3>Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na</h3>
<p>Imran Khan in the role of Jai Singh Rathore is believable and does complete justice to the role. Genelia D'Souza is fresh, beautiful and natural in every frame. Both the lead actors have surely secured a place in the industry. Naseeruddin Shah in a cameo is excellent and takes the movie to a different level.</p>
